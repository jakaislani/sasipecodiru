He called the left-wing campus protesters “juvenile idiots” and said that “prisoners are now running the asylum.”</p><p>Law School Dean, Jenny Martinez and Stanford President, Marc Tessier-Lavinge,&nbsp;f<a href=#>ormally apologized to the judge&nbsp;</a>a few days after the event, confirming that protesters and administrators had violated Stanford’s policies.</p><p>“We write to apologize for the disruption of your recent speech at Stanford Law School,” Tessier-Lavigne and Martinez wrote in a joint statement. “As has already been communicated to our community, what happened was inconsistent with our policies on free speech, and we are very sorry about the experience you had while visiting our campus.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Steinbach was placed on leave after the incident. <span class=credit>Vimeo / Ethics and Public Policy Center</span></figure><p>The letter didn’t mention Steinbach by name, but claimed that staff members did not enforce Stanford’s policies and “intervened in inappropriate ways” that did not align with the school’s commitment to free speech.&nbsp;</p><p>Duncan recounted the experience in a WSJ op-ed on March 17, admitting that he was criticized by the media for his anger at the protestors, but refused to apologize for calling them “appalling idiots,” “bullies” and “hypocrites” because “Sometimes anger is the proper response to vicious behavior.”</p><p>“The most disturbing aspect of this shameful debacle is what it says about the state of legal education,” he wrote. “Stanford is an elite law school. The protesters showed not the foggiest grasp of the basic concepts of legal discourse: That one must meet reason with reason, not power.”&nbsp;</p><p>“That jeering contempt is the opposite of persuasion,” he added. “That the law protects the speaker from the mob, not the mob from the speaker. Worst of all, Ms. Steinbach’s remarks made clear she is proud that Stanford students are being&nbsp;taught&nbsp;this is the way law should be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21mamlfqMGiusWoqZ1llJq2brDEmqVmmZSitrW%2FjKyfnmWUnrGvwIygnK1loprAsbvNrJxmrJ9iwLXBw56lratdnbKkt8uipaBln5t6q8HDoJxmqpmctbV7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstanford-dei-dean-admits-she-didnt-get-response-to-students-heckling-of-judge-right.html&text=Stanford%20DEI%20dean%20admits%20she%20didn%27t%20get%20response%20to%20students%27%20heckling%20of%20judge%20%27right%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstanford-dei-dean-admits-she-didnt-get-response-to-students-heckling-of-judge-right.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstanford-dei-dean-admits-she-didnt-get-response-to-students-heckling-of-judge-right.html&title=Stanford%20DEI%20dean%20admits%20she%20didn%27t%20get%20response%20to%20students%27%20heckling%20of%20judge%20%27right%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstanford-dei-dean-admits-she-didnt-get-response-to-students-heckling-of-judge-right.html&title=Stanford%20DEI%20dean%20admits%20she%20didn%27t%20get%20response%20to%20students%27%20heckling%20of%20judge%20%27right%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstanford-dei-dean-admits-she-didnt-get-response-to-students-heckling-of-judge-right.html&title=Stanford%20DEI%20dean%20admits%20she%20didn%27t%20get%20response%20to%20students%27%20heckling%20of%20judge%20%27right%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstanford-dei-dean-admits-she-didnt-get-response-to-students-heckling-of-judge-right.html&description=Stanford%20DEI%20dean%20admits%20she%20didn%27t%20get%20response%20to%20students%27%20heckling%20of%20judge%20%27right%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tracee-ellis-ross-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tracee Ellis Ross net worth, husband, children, TV shows, awards, Instagram">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alex-pall-wiki-bio-net-worth-age.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Pall Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age (The Chainsmokers) Girlfriend, Wife, Affairs, Songs, Heigh">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
