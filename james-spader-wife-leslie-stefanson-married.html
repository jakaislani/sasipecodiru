After making his debut, Spader starred in several hugely successful films and television shows, including Lincoln and The Backlist.</strong></p><p>Moving on to his romantic life, Spader was formerly wed to Victoria Spader, who is currently his ex-wife. Additionally, the ex-flames had two kids together. Leslie Stefanson, his former co-star in Alien Hunter, and the star of The Backlist are currently in a committed partnership.</p><p>The insider information about James’ romantic history, including his failed marriage to Victoria and his current connection with Leslie, is revealed here. Let’s investigate more closely!</p><h2><span id=Who_Was_Victoria_the_Wife_of_James_Spader>Who Was Victoria, the Wife of James Spader?</span></h2><p>Victoria Kheel, Spader’s spouse, used to design film sets and was involved in a few on-screen roles, including Jack’s Back. She also worked as a designer on the set of Sex, Lies, and Videotape, her husband James’s 1989 film, which was the production that made her famous.</p><p>However, Kheel currently owns Wonderland Home Design, a real estate firm in California. It puts townhomes, condominiums, and houses on stage.</p><p>Spader and his wife Victoria tied the knot in a secret ceremony in 1987. The two reportedly initially met in a yoga class in New York City, according to sources. Before deciding to move their relationship further in 1987, the ex-couple dated for a number of years.</p><h2><span id=severalader_his_two_boys_and_his_wife_Victoria_Kheel>severalader, his two boys, and his wife Victoria Kheel.</span></h2><p>For years, the ex-couple enjoyed a lovely relationship. However, it didn’t last long, and after more than fifteen years of marriage, they parted ways. In 2004, their divorce became official.</p><p>Although the cause for their breakup has not been revealed, it has been rumored that James filed for divorce.</p><h2><span id=How_Many_Kids_Does_the_Ex-Couple_Have_Together>How Many Kids Does the Ex-Couple Have Together?</span></h2><p>The ex-couple has two children. 1989 saw the birth of James Spader’s first child, a boy called Sebastian Spader. Sebastian works as a director and producer as well. In 1992, Elijah Spader, their second son, was welcomed into the family.</p><p>After Divorce, Is James Spader Married? Dating Leslie Stefanson, His Girlfriend</p><p>The Blacklist actor is single following his split with Victoria. Nonetheless, Spader had an extramarital affair with actress and model Leslie Stefanson while he was still married to his wife Victoria. Since 2002, the couple has been dating. After dating for over six years, they got engaged in 2008.</p><p>James Spader and Leslie Stefanson, his girlfriend who later engaged</p><p>Leslie is supportive of James even though she is 11 years his younger, and they have been in a happy partnership for almost 20 years. Moreover, the two are members of the same fraternity, which is regarded as the primary factor in their long-lasting partnership.</p><p>Spader stated to Playboy back in 2014 that he prefers to keep things private. He declared,</p><p>Even when I’m in public, I’ve had great luck maintaining my privacy. You can attract attention to yourself in public if you’re identifiable. I’m not. People get the impression that they’ve come to know someone through the media if they lead highly publicized lifestyles. I make an effort to keep my personal life secret from the public.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_Leslie_Stefanson_and_James_Spader_Get_Together>How Did Leslie Stefanson and James Spader Get Together?</span></h2><p>When they initially met, neither Stefanson nor Spader disclosed. According to tabloids, the two initially crossed paths on the production of the 2002 murder drama The Stickup. The next year, they were back again in the science-fiction thriller Alien Hunter.</p><p>In 2008, they welcomed their first child.</p><p>On August 31, 2008, the couple welcomed a son, Nathaneal Spader, into the world. The world first learned of the pregnancy on May 18, 2008, when James’s girlfriend Stefanson seemed to be carrying a baby bulge at Los Angeles International Airport.</p><p>Spader currently lives in a carriage house in Greenwich Village with his partner Leslie and their son, who is 12 years old.</p><h2><span id=Some_Fascinating_Details_About_James_Spader>Some Fascinating Details About James Spader</span></h2><p>In addition to being a skilled chef, he likes to cook.</p><ul><li>James’s voice is sweet and rich.</li><li>is well-known for playing cunning and nasty parts.</li><li>He is a devoted follower of the legendary Bob Dylan.</li><li>In the American mockumentary sitcom The Office, which also starred Timothy Olyphant, the husband of Alexis Knief, he had a crucial role.</li></ul><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Cecilia Allman, Marian Krawstor, and Bronlie Jacobs."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cecilia-allman/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/marian-krawstor/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://popularbio.com/bronlie-jacobs/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Palm Beach Nursing School Scandal: 25 People Are Charged In A Wire Fraud Scheme</a></h3>The Palm Beach Nursing School Scandal comes on the heels of Operation Nightingale, which revealed 7,600 phony nursing credentials in Florida against 25 persons.According to federal prosecutors, th <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Lala_Saddi Muslim | Religion Ethnicity And Origin</a></h3>Fans throughout the world are glued to their seats, eager to find out the truth about her ideas.
