He is the son of sports broadcaster Tom Harmon and model-turned-actor Elyse Knox. His older sisters – the late Kristin Nelson (née Harmon) and Kelly Harmon were also actors.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>Like his father, Harmon excelled as a football player. From 1972-1973, he was a starting quarterback for the UCLA Bruins and received the National Football Foundation Award for All-Round Excellence. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Communication in 1974.</p><p data-characters=1236 data-current-count=1489 data-injectable=true>His father was the national spokesman for Kellogg’s cereal, and Harmon caught the acting bug after they appeared in a commercial together. His sister Kristin was married to actor and musician Ricky Nelson, whose parents were the stars of&nbsp;Ozzie’s Girls. Harmon’s career as a television actor began when he appeared as a guest on the show. He established a successful career as a character actor, appearing on shows like&nbsp;Laverne & Shirley&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&nbsp;and in films, including&nbsp;Comes a Horseman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Beyond the Poseidon Adventure.

Harmon caught the eye of producer Donald P. Bellisario who cast him in the guest role of Leroy Jethro Gibbs for two episodes of JAG. The character resonated so strongly with viewers that Bellasio created the show&nbsp;NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service,&nbsp;which starred Harmon as Gibbs from 2003 to 2022.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Harmon is known for his love of privacy.
