Taeyang’s singing ability has been highly praised by music critics, and he is considered one of the best Korean singers.</p><p>Taeyang was scheduled to debut with Kwon as the hip-hop duo GDYB (Kwon chose the stage name G-Dragon), but that plan was scrapped by their record label. Raw (TOP, Taesung, Seungri, Hyunseung) joined to form the group BIGBANG. Their formation was recorded on TV, but Hyunseung dropped out before their official debut, and the final lineup consisted of five members.</p><p>Taeyang’s first full-length album Solar was released in July 2010 in two versions: “Normal Edition” and “Deluxe Edition”. The regular edition includes 11 songs, while the deluxe edition, which is limited to 30,000 copies, includes 13 songs, including Hot’s “Only Look at Me” and “Prayer.” The “Deluxe Edition” was sold out on the first day of sale.</p><p>For promotion, he released two singles: “I need a girl” and “I’m there”. In Solar, Taeyang contributed to its production. He composed and co-wrote four songs (“Solar,” “Where U At,” “Wedding Dress,” and “Take It Slow”) and wrote the lyrics for “Take It Slow.” Taeyang won the Best Male Artist Award at the 2010 Mnet Asia Music Awards. Both regular and deluxe editions topped Gaon’s album charts.</p><p>Like the rest of BIGBANG, Taeyang is characterized by “how seriously he takes his craft and artistry” as opposed to other “manufactured K-pop frontiers”. Taeyang was introduced to pop music by his older brother at the age of six with the music of American singer Michael Jackson. However, although he has primarily become a singer and dancer in R&B, he is also known for fusing R&B with hip-hop, soul, and EDM on his solo albums.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Which band does Kai belong to?</h2><p>Kai is the stage name of Kim Jong-in, a South Korean singer, dancer, model, and actor. He is a part of the Chinese-South Korean boy band Exo, Exo-K, and South Korean supergroup SuperM. With the publication of his extended play in November 2020, he made his solo debut.</p><p>Besides his musical career, Kai has also appeared in various TV dramas such as Choco Bank (2016), Andante (2017) and Spring Has Come (2018). Kai is widely recognized as one of Korea’s top dancers in K-pop and is also one of the most influential Korean fashion icons.</p><p>In 2007, on his father’s recommendation, he entered SM Entertainment’s Youth Best Contest and won. At the age of 13, he signed up with the company. After that, he started his hip-hop dance training. On December 23, 2011, SM announced Kai as the first member of the company’s up-and-coming boys band Exo.</p><p>On December 29, 2011, he appeared on TV with his fellow Exo members Luhan, Chen, Tao, and other SM artists at the SBS Gayo Daejun year-end music show. The group has enjoyed great popularity and commercial success since its official debut in April 2012.</p><p>In January 2016, Kai made his acting debut as the male lead in the web drama “Choco Bank” and achieved record-breaking ratings. In December 2016, he appeared in two episodes of the web drama 7 First Kisses, a special produced by Lotte Duty-Free.</p><p>In January 2017, Kai played the male lead in the KBS youth drama Andante, in which he plays a high school student. This is the first time that a foreign actor plays a leading role in a drama produced by WOWOW.</p><p>In March 2020, Kai became an ambassador for the Italian luxury fashion house Gucci alongside Chinese actress Nini. Later that year, Kai became Bobbi Brown’s first male muse for cosmetics. In January 2022, Charm zone Mask selected Kai as its new model, “hoping to convey a youthful and trendy image of Charm zone’s premium mask products.” The BlackYak Climbing Crew has chosen Kai as the model for their Black Yak BCC collection. Later that year, Kai became the muse of Yves Saint Laurent Beauty.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>www.Ghgossip.com</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqSgp59dpLNut8%2Bop2avmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZueu6h5zp9kpKifpXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fking-of-kpop-who-is-the-king-of-kpop.html&text=King%20Of%20Kpop%202023%2c%20Who%20Is%20The%20King%20of%20Kpop%202023%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fking-of-kpop-who-is-the-king-of-kpop.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fking-of-kpop-who-is-the-king-of-kpop.html&title=King%20Of%20Kpop%202023%2c%20Who%20Is%20The%20King%20of%20Kpop%202023%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fking-of-kpop-who-is-the-king-of-kpop.html&title=King%20Of%20Kpop%202023%2c%20Who%20Is%20The%20King%20of%20Kpop%202023%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fking-of-kpop-who-is-the-king-of-kpop.html&title=King%20Of%20Kpop%202023%2c%20Who%20Is%20The%20King%20of%20Kpop%202023%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fking-of-kpop-who-is-the-king-of-kpop.html&description=King%20Of%20Kpop%202023%2c%20Who%20Is%20The%20King%20of%20Kpop%202023%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./steven-r-monroe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steven R.
