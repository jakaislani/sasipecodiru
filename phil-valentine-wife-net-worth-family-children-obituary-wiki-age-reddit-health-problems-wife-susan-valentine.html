He was the host of “The Phil Valentine Show” on SuperTalk 99.7 WTN in Nashville. “The Phil Valentine Show is a conservative talk radio show based in Nashville. The show is the recipient of 20 AIR Awards and was chosen Best Talk Show by the New York Festivals Awards,” according to the talk show website. He became a popular conservative Nashville talk show host in 2001 by railing against a state income tax proposed then by Republican Gov. Don Sundquist.</p><p>Valentine grew his program into a nationally syndicated show that aired for 12 years on as many as 100 stations. At the end of the run, Valentine signed a three-year deal in 2019 that kept him on Super Talk 99.7 WTN.</p><p>Valentine grew up wanting to be a rock star, and he started fronting bands at age 13. He quit college and went to broadcasting school after a friend, Steve Brown, said, “You’ve got a deep voice. Why don’t you do radio?”</p><p>Valentine was the author of three books, The Conservative’s Handbook: Defining the Right Position on Issues from A to Z, Tax Revolt: The Rebellion Against an Overbearing, Bloated, Arrogant, and Abusive Government, and Right from the Heart: The ABC’s of Reality in America. He was a Weekly columnist for newspapers across the country and formerly a featured columnist in The Sunday Tennessean. He contributed columns for Talkers Magazine, Insight Magazine and many others.</p><p>On January 27, 2012, Rocky Mountain Pictures released Valentine’s documentary, An Inconsistent Truth, in theaters. Since then the movie has won three film festivals including the Nevada Film Festival. It was released on DVD in 2013 and shot immediately to the #1 position on Amazon.com’s documentary chart. It is the 20th top-grossing nature documentary at the box office in U.S. history. He had a cameo role in the 2014 movie, Atlas Shrugged III: Who is John Galt. He also had a supporting role in the movie, The Secret Handshake, starring Kevin Sorbo.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=phil-valentine-age></span> Phil Valentine Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Phil Valentine was born on September 9, 1959, in Nashville, North Carolina.

The radio station tweeted: “We are saddened to report that our host and friend Phil Valentine has passed away. Please keep the Valentine family in your thoughts and prayers.”</p><p>The long-time radio personality was reportedly “fighting for his life” after he was transferred to a critical care unit in a Tennessee hospital in late July.</p><p>“Phil contracted the Covid virus a little over a week ago & has since been hospitalized & is in very serious condition, suffering from Covid Pneumonia and the attendant side effects. He is in the hospital in the critical care unit breathing with assistance but is NOT on a ventilator. We’d ask that everyone please refrain from contacting him while he is in the hospital,” his brother, Mark Valentine, said in a statement at the time.</p><p>“Phil would like for his listeners to know that while he has never been an “anti-vaxer” he regrets not being more vehemently ‘Pro-Vaccine’, and looks forward to being able to more vigorously advocate that position as soon as he is back. on the air, which we all hope will be soon.</p><p>“Phil & his family would like for all of you to know that he loves ya’ll and appreciates your concern, thoughts & prayers more than you will ever know.

My deepest condolences and prayers are with Phil’s wife, Susan, and his family. May they be comforted and surrounded by love during this difficult time.”</p><p>Tennessee State Representative Cameron Sexton tweeted: “@ValentineShow made a difference in life as a strong conservative voice & leading the fight to stop the state income tax two decades ago. He will be greatly missed by all! Our heartfelt prayers & deepest sympathies go out to the Valentine family & Phil’s radio family @997wtn.”</p><p>Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee wrote on Twitter: “Maria and I are deeply saddened by the loss of Phil Valentine and pray for his family as they navigate the difficult days ahead.”</p><p>Phil’s brother, Mark Valentine, paid tribute to his sibling in a Facebook post. He wrote: “As many of you already know, my wonderful brother, Phil passed away from Covid this past Saturday. It is hard to process losing a best friend and a brother at the same time. Phil was a self-made man. He had many God-given talents that he honed & perfected to create a ‘Storybook’ life that few can imagine.</p><p>“In addition to being an incredible Radio/TV Personality, he was a great singer, songwriter, & author. He also had a brilliant analytical mind & could take the most complicated political issues and reduce them to the point that they became simple. I was his biggest fan & his most fierce defender & advocate.</p><p>“Beyond all of his myriad professional accomplishments, his biggest and best legacy was his family. Phil, Susan, Carr, Campbell & Douglas were more than a family, they were a team & ARE a team. I’ve never seen anything like it.</p><p>“Now the Captain of the team is gone but the team remains and will move forward saddened but unbroken…you can depend on that. Phil’s optimism and zest for living is coursing through those boy’s veins and they will all do great things as the Co-Captain of the team, Susan continues to do what she does best which is to love and nurture those boys through this. Phil, I love you man…you will never be forgotten!”</p><p>Phil Valentine’s sister, Beth Valentine Dollar, wrote the following emotional letter to his brother following his death, via News 2:</p><p>“Dear Phil,</p><p>Steve and Mark were born 17 months apart and always so close. Then, when I came along five years after you, it was you and me. We were a team, and I cannot believe that you are gone. You were my very first playmate. Even Mama wrote in my baby book that I could pronounce all of the boys’ names well – especially Pheeeel! She even told me that after school instead of going outside to play, you’d want to play with your toddler sister. She’d make you go outside and play with your friends! Some of my earliest and best memories are when you’d get me out of bed, when I was three or so, on Saturday mornings. You’d fix our bowls of cereal, and we’d sit on the floor close to the TV to watch cartoons. In all of my birthday home movies, you were always right by my side handing me presents, helping me open them, and making a big deal about them.</p><p>As I grew to school age and began having friends over to play or spend the night, you always got the games and fun going for us. I remember you dressing in your super hero costumes and leading the charge! One day we even cut a hole in a huge box to make it look like a TV. We had Daddy come up after work, and you read the news to him while I sat behind you and typed on a typewriter for sound effects. Just like Cronkite, and you even wore a coat and tie!</p><p>I also remember that I thought you had magic (I know-too many Bewitched episodes) when you’d open the freezer and command the interior light to go off, and it did. I was amazed for many years until you finally confessed that you were pressing a button with your knee! You also helped me win a magic show in second grade using vinegar and an egg, and you wrote this catchy line: When I make this raw egg fall, it will bounce like a rubber ball. Genius!</p><p>I also remember the wonderful boy band The Nashville Five, and I can’t hear I’ll be There by the Jackson Five without thinking of your excellent rendition of it. Remember that I got so mad when you wouldn’t let me be a GoGo dancer? I had the white patent boots to swing it, too. But I showed you by decorating your favorite tambourine with magic markers!</p><p>I fondly remember when you had friends over, and you were so patient when I wanted to tag along or just hang out. We played many games of pool as you schooled me on 60s and 70s music – you knew all the back stories on the songs and the singers, especially your Beatles phase. And when you brought home Frampton Comes Alive!, you thought it was right up there with sliced bread. We kept listening to that song when he made the guitar talk! Magical times, for sure.</p><p>Around this time you graduated from high school when I was in the 6th grade. When you left ECU and pursued radio, I was some kind of proud to hear you on the air or go to an event where you were the DJ. When you were at WRMT in Rocky Mount, Mama would have the intercom radio on, and she’d turn down the music and turn up your commercials. She was a proud mama!</p><p>Then, on the darkest day of our lives, you were the one who told me about Mama’s wreck and death. I remember falling into your chest crying and you held me. Hard to believe that was 40 years ago last week on August 14 when I was 16 and you were 21. We hung together with Steve, Mark, and Daddy and learned, much to our surprise, that we would laugh again and get back to living.</p><p>Four years later, in 1985, you packed all that you had and headed that Honda Prelude to Nashville, TN to conquer it, and you did! I have always been so proud that you went out there not knowing a soul to pursue your radio and song writing dreams. I brag on you to this day with that story often! We were all so proud of you, and I looked forward to driving out every summer to see you. You were making your own way and were so successful.</p><p>Then you met your beautiful, funny, and smart wife, Susan, and were married in 1990. I’d never seen you so happy, and you two were perfect for each other. She will always be my sister-in-law. Then came along your three fabulous boys, and your life was complete. I loved the caring, loving, and affectionate dad you became. As the boys grew, it was so sweet to see how you interacted with them with such love, laughter, and unconditional love. They were lucky to have you as a dad because it seemed that role came so naturally to you. When I think of the wonderful life that you made in Nashville and the wonderful family you have, it just plain makes me happy.</p><p>Not only were you a success in your personal life, you had a career to be proud of. Starting out as a DJ and moving to talk radio, you were always in your element. The countless awards you received and the respect from your colleagues makes this evident. But, wait, it doesn’t stop there! You became a well written author and the creator of dozens of lyrics and songs. I remember reading one of your books on the beach a few summers back, and I was about to explode with pride. I wanted to go up to everyone on the beach and say, “Look at this author! He’s my brother!”.</p><p>As we both became busy with our families and work, we sometimes went weeks without talking, but I always knew you were just a phone call away, and you were never far from my heart and thoughts.</p><p>Today is the second hardest day of my life because now I can’t pick up my phone to call or text. My heart is breaking for your precious Susan, Carr, Campbell, and Douglas as well as Steve, Mark, Barbara, and all of our family and friends. I’m so glad Steven, Harrison, Anna, and I got to spend time with you in June. I’ll miss your laughter, your advice, your encouragement, and your sense of humor. I could always count on you, and you couldn’t have been a better brother if you tried. This hurts so much, but our wonderful memories will help. I love you so very much. You get to see Mama before I do, so please catch her up. Tell Daddy we miss him everyday, too. Give them both a big hug for me, and when people ask me how many brothers I have, I will always say three.</p><p>I love you, Phil,</p><p>Beth”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=phil-valentine-cause-of-death></span> Phil Valentine Cause of Death<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Phil Valentine’s cause of death was complications from COVID-19.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=phil-valentine-net-worth></span> Phil Valentine Net Worth<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Phil Valentine’s net worth is estimated to be $2 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=phil-valentine-obituary></span> Phil Valentine Obituary<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKiYnrluwsClnKesmaOybsPIn5xmppWperi70a2fZp6RoratxYycn6KklKeyr3nOm6CtrZGnxm7DyKSgZpmXmnqzscOdoK1lmJqurcDHZqerp5Khsq6%2FjLCgn51dqMK0rc1mrZqklaPBqrrEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fphil-valentine-wife-net-worth-family-children-obituary-wiki-age-reddit-health-problems-wife-susan-valentine.html&text=Phil%20Valentine%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Obituary%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Reddit%2c%20Health%20Problems%2c%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fphil-valentine-wife-net-worth-family-children-obituary-wiki-age-reddit-health-problems-wife-susan-valentine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fphil-valentine-wife-net-worth-family-children-obituary-wiki-age-reddit-health-problems-wife-susan-valentine.html&title=Phil%20Valentine%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Obituary%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Reddit%2c%20Health%20Problems%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fphil-valentine-wife-net-worth-family-children-obituary-wiki-age-reddit-health-problems-wife-susan-valentine.html&title=Phil%20Valentine%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Obituary%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Reddit%2c%20Health%20Problems%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fphil-valentine-wife-net-worth-family-children-obituary-wiki-age-reddit-health-problems-wife-susan-valentine.html&title=Phil%20Valentine%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Obituary%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Reddit%2c%20Health%20Problems%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fphil-valentine-wife-net-worth-family-children-obituary-wiki-age-reddit-health-problems-wife-susan-valentine.html&description=Phil%20Valentine%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Obituary%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Reddit%2c%20Health%20Problems%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./untold-truth-cher.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Untold Truth Of Cher">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jay-stansfield.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jay Stansfield">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
