His dad is dead of a heart attack; drugs may have had something to do with that, but we don't know. Lenny was his dad's best friend, and is now his mother's lover and supplier. He's a hard man, but not as hard as some drug dealers we've seen; he likes Mel, and thinks that supplying her addiction is a form of helping her.</p><p>Addiction wears down ordinary standards of human conduct, until people behave in ways they would have considered unthinkable. Consider Vicki, a hooker whose small child, Rose, is sometimes watched by Mel. Mel is on the bus with the baby, and a man who says he is a doctor tells her the child has an infection and needs immediate attention. What Mel does then makes sense only if you understand that heroin has to come first before anything else in her life can proceed.</p><p>Paul is always on the move, running or riding his bicycle, acting as a parent for Lee and in a way for his mother. He makes friends where he finds them. The waitress Louise (<a href=#>Keira Knightley</a>), for example, is nice to him and he confides in her. Like everyone in his world, she's into drugs. Eventually he asks her if he can try some: "I want to know how Mom feels." Her first response: "You can wait until you're 11."</p><p>Always lurking about is a police detective (<a href=#>Gary Lewis</a>), who knows that Lenny is an important supplier in the neighborhood, but can't prove it by catching him in possession. As the plot plays out, young Paul find himself involved in the game between Lenny and the detective, in ways he does not understand or even guess.</p><p>One scene in the movie is painful almost beyond describing. Mel determines to get off drugs, cold turkey. She will lock herself in her room and Paul is not to listen to her, no matter what she says, until she is clean. To assist in this process, her resourceful son nails her bedroom door shut. This leads to a confrontation between mother and son that no child should ever have to endure, although I have a sad feeling that many do.</p><p>Molly Parker is an extraordinary actress of the ordinary. In the strange and daring "<a href=#>Kissed</a>" (1996), she played a necrophiliac employee of a funeral home, whose feelings about the dead were not only perverse but, in an inexplicable way, tender and sorrowful. Not many actresses could have made the role acceptable, let alone believable, but Parker did. She did it by calmly accepting the reality of her character and never stepping outside it. Here she plays a drug addict whose treatment of her children is cruel and uncaring, and yet she is the best mother it is possible for her to be. She doesn't make Mel into a grotesque caricature; Mel is even more disturbing, really, because she tries to behave better than the drugs will allow her to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46prKudXWd9cYE%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpure-2005.html&text=Pure%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%282005%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpure-2005.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpure-2005.html&title=Pure%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%282005%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpure-2005.html&title=Pure%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%282005%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpure-2005.html&title=Pure%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%282005%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpure-2005.html&description=Pure%20movie%20review%20%26amp%3b%20film%20summary%20%282005%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-vishera-review-amd-fx8350-fx8320-fx6300-and-fx4300-tested.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="AMD FX-8350, FX-8320, FX-6300 and FX-4300 Tested">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pistachio-goji-berry-granola.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pistachio Goji Berry Granola">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
