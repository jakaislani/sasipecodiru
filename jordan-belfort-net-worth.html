But how much is Jordan Belfort worth today, and how did he come by his fortune? This article will look at his career, accomplishments, and net worth.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Early Life and Career Beginnings</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Jordan Belfort was born on July 9, 1962, to a Jewish household in Queens, New York. He grew raised in a middle-class area, the son of accountants. He studied biology at American University and graduated with honors.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He then enrolled in dental school but dropped out after the dean informed him that dentistry was not a lucrative profession. Belfort began his career as a door-to-door salesman of meat and fish. He went on to become a stockbroker, and in 1987, he co-founded Stratton Oakmont with his friend Danny Porush.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The firm specializes in penny stocks, which are low-cost, high-risk shares of small businesses. Belfort and his brokers employed aggressive and dishonest tactics to convince investors to acquire these stocks, increasing their prices and reaping massive commissions.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Rise to Fame and Success</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Using a “pump and dump” strategy, Belfort and his firm made millions of dollars in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They would artificially inflate the values of the stocks they owned before selling them at a large profit before the prices fell.</p><p style=text-align:justify>They also engaged in illicit operations such as money laundering, tax evasion, and insider trading. Belfort earned the moniker “Wolf of Wall Street” and led a lavish lifestyle. He had a Long Island house, a yacht, a helicopter, and several luxury cars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jordan-Belfort-Net-Worth-1.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>He also spent a fortune on drugs, drink, prostitutes, parties, and travel. He was married twice, and his second wife, Nadine Caridi, had two children.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Belfort’s peak net worth was believed to be over $200 million, although some sources believe it was more than $1 billion. He was one of Wall Street’s most successful and infamous stockbrokers, with a cult-like following among his workers and clientele.</p><strong>See how much other famous people earn by clicking here:</strong><ul><li><a href=#>Dom DiSandro Net Worth: The Security Chief of the Philadelphia Eagles</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Bobby Lee Net Worth 2023: Exploring His Million Wealth</a></li></ul><h2 style=text-align:justify>Fall from Grace and Legal Troubles</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Belfort’s fraudulent and unlawful activities eventually drew the notice of authorities, who investigated him with the FBI, the SEC, and the NASD. He was arrested and accused of securities fraud and money laundering in 1998.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In exchange for a lower sentence, he pled guilty and agreed to collaborate with the government. He also agreed to repay $110 million to the investors he duped. Belfort was sentenced to four years in prison in 2003, but he only served 22 months of that time in a minimum-security facility.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He was also forced to give up the majority of his possessions, including his mansion, yacht, and cars. He was released in 2006 and sentenced to pay 50% of his earnings to the reparations fund until his debt was paid off.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Jordan Belfort Career and Current Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Belfort reinvented himself as an author and motivational speaker after his release from prison. He documented his rise and fall as a stockbroker in two memoirs, The Wolf of Wall Street (2007) and Catching the Wolf of Wall Street (2009).</p><p style=text-align:justify>Martin Scorsese adapted the books into a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, which was a critical and commercial success. Belfort has founded his own company, Belfort Training, which provides business and individual sales training and coaching.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Jordan Belfort (@wolfofwallst)</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>A speaking engagement can cost up to $75,000, and a sales conference can cost up to $1 million. He also receives royalties from his books and movies, and he has stakes in real estate, technology, and biotechnology.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Belfort’s net worth is expected to reach around $115 million in 2023</strong>. He still owes his victims over $100 million and has only paid approximately $14 million so far. He asserts that he is dedicated to repaying the entire sum and that he is negotiating a settlement with the authorities to expedite the process.</p><h3 style=text-align:justify>Conclusion</h3><p style=text-align:justify>Jordan Belfort, a contentious and interesting figure, has seen riches and renown rise and fall. A powerful and rich stockbroker, he made and lost millions through deception and manipulation. After being convicted, he went to prison and lost most of his possessions.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He is now a prominent author and speaker who teaches sales and persuasion. He is notorious, owes his victims a lot, and has legal and ethical issues. He is a Wall Street wolf who shaped finance and culture.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX5%2B8s7DAp2SbnZybvLPAjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI5vZ3BvZ2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjordan-belfort-net-worth.html&text=Jordan%20Belfort%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Wolf%20of%20Wall%20Street%20Made%20and%20Lost%20His%20Fortune&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjordan-belfort-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjordan-belfort-net-worth.html&title=Jordan%20Belfort%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Wolf%20of%20Wall%20Street%20Made%20and%20Lost%20His%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjordan-belfort-net-worth.html&title=Jordan%20Belfort%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Wolf%20of%20Wall%20Street%20Made%20and%20Lost%20His%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjordan-belfort-net-worth.html&title=Jordan%20Belfort%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Wolf%20of%20Wall%20Street%20Made%20and%20Lost%20His%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjordan-belfort-net-worth.html&description=Jordan%20Belfort%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Wolf%20of%20Wall%20Street%20Made%20and%20Lost%20His%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lis-vega.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lis Vega">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jerry-jewell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jerry Jewell">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
