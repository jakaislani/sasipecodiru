He’s got many challenges ahead and maintaining the balance is going to be an even harder feat than it was before.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=577 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>The series comes from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellowstone</a> creator Taylor Sheridan and it’s a hard-hitting look at the prison system. The story takes place in the fictional Kingstown, Michigan, but it comes off as more real than your standard, case-of-the-week network procedural. McLusky is the unofficial mayor and acts as an intermediary between the police, the prisons, and the streets. He fosters relationships with all sides, not letting his emotions get the better of him so he can do what’s best for everyone, but with so many conflicting motivations, things explode in a major way.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><h2 id=h-the-story-so-far data-injectable=false>The story so far</h2><p data-characters=651 data-current-count=951 data-injectable=true>Mike McLusky comes from a family of power brokers; his brother Kyle (Taylor Handley)&nbsp;is a police officer, and his mother Miriam McLusky (Dianne Wiest) is a no-nonsense college professor who volunteers to teach at the Kingstown Women’s Prison. Kingstown is a prison town with seven prisons in total that hold 20,000 people, all within a 10-mile radius. The eldest McLusky brother, Mitch (Kyle Chandler) was the original unofficial mayor, and Mike helps him. After Mitch McLusky is gunned down by someone looking for the money in the McLusky brothers’ offices, Mike has to take on his brother’s role and find out who killed Mitch.</p><p data-characters=778 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>Mike McLusky had his hands full in season one. He saves a young woman named Iris (Emma Laird) from a gang, looks out for gang leader Deverin “Bunny” Washington’s (Tobi Bamtefa) people in and out of prison, and tries to clean up the mess that Sam (Mandela Van Peebles), a novice prison guard left. After a prisoner gets shot and killed by a trigger-happy Sam, the prisoners take matters into their own hands and riot. The prison has been seized and they’re holding the guards hostage, one of which is Kyle. Mike has to find Kyle and negotiate with the leader to calm things down. A SWAT team uses the sewers to breach the prison and take back control. Mike isn’t able to convince them and when the SWAT team enters the sewer, it’s a bloodbath.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Mayor of Kingstown season two plot</h2><p data-characters=645 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>Mayor of Kingstown season two will deal with the consequences of the riot and all the remaining chaos. Mike will have to cope with the fallout of the riot from season one, and we can only assume that faith in him will need to be restored. The riot broke out while Mike was at his cabin in the woods and he didn’t know about the riot until things had already exacerbated to an extreme point. Despite this fact, he’ll have to earn back the trust of all sides because so many people died in the riot. This job has always seemed like a mandate rather than a passion, but he’ll need to work overtime if he wants to set things right.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kingstown packs a punch. <a href=#>#MayorOfKingstown</a> <a href=#>#ParamountPlus</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/r3tiSHGS7k</a></p>— Mayor of Kingstown (@kingstown) <a href=#>November 7, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-injectable=false>Season two cast</h2><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=914 data-injectable=true>Renner will of course be back to star in this crime drama, and so will Wiest as his concerned mother Miriam, and Tyler Handey as Kyle, his career-focused brother. In an interview with FilmSpeak, Wiest expressed her joy at playing a character who’s unbothered by others’ opinions. “It is freeing, in many ways, to [play] such an angry woman. That you don’t care what people think of you. It’s also it’s a lot of work because that’s a cover for her. It’s her way of mourning the [death] of her husband.” Expect Miriam to continue to speak her mind in season two.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>Laird is back as Iris and Yellowstone alum Hugh Dillon returns as senior narcotic, robbery, and homicide detective for the Kingstown Police Department, Ian Fergus.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>Crime boss Milo Sunter — played by Aidan Gillen from Game of Thrones — will be stirring up more trouble for Mike and the city in season two. Mike arrested him for an armored car heist, but even though he’s been imprisoned, he’s still been able to control events outside of his four walls. Mike’s associate and friend Bunny, and police officer Stevie — played by Derek Webster — both return.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Release date and where to stream</h2><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>The first episode of Mayor of Kingstown season two will stream on Jan. 15, 2023, in the U.S. and Canada on Paramount Plus.
